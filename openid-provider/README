Uses JanRain's Python OpenID library, version 1.2.0, licensed under the
Apache Software License 2.0:
  http://openidenabled.com/python-openid/

It uses version 1.2.0 (included here), not a later version, because this app
was originally written a long time ago when 1.2.0 was the latest version
available. Porting to 2.1.1 or later should be straightforward.

The JanRain library includes a reference OpenID consumer that can be used to
test this provider. After starting the dev_appserver with this app, unpack the
JanRain library and run these commands from its root directory:

  setenv PYTHONPATH .
  python ./examples/consumer.py -s localhost

Then go to http://localhost:8001/ in your browser, type in
http://localhost:8080/myname as your openid identifier, and click Verify.
